Overview of the Project
Project: To-do list application


Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple and functional To-Do List application using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) to-do items, helping them manage their tasks efficiently.

Key Activities
Setting Up the Environment:

Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install and configure necessary packages, including Express.js and Mongoose.
Database Connection:

Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Handle database connection errors and confirm successful connections.
API Development:

Create a Todo model using Mongoose with fields for name and completed.
Develop RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD operations:
GET /todos: Retrieve all to-do items.
GET /todos/:id: Retrieve a specific to-do item by ID.
POST /todos: Create a new to-do item.
PUT /todos/:id: Update a specific to-do item by ID.
DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a specific to-do item by ID.
Server Setup:

Initialize an Express.js server.
Set up middleware for JSON parsing.
Define the root route (/) to serve as the home page.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement error handling for database operations and server issues.
Log important events, such as server startup and database connection status.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
Express.js: Web framework for handling routing and middleware.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing to-do items.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing schema-based solutions.
JavaScript: Programming language used for developing the application.
